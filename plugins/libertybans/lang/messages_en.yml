# %START_DATE% - the date the punishment was created
# %TIME_PASSED% - the time since the punishment was created
# %TIME_PASSED_SIMPLE% - the time since the punishment was created, rounded to the biggest time unit possible (e.g. 2 months instead of 1 month 23 days)
# %END_DATE% - the date the punishment will end, or formatting.permanent-display.absolute for permanent punishments
# %TIME_REMAINING% - the time until the punishment ends, or formatting.permanent-display.relative for permanent punishments
# %TIME_REMAINING_SIMPLE% - the time until the punishment ends, rounded to the biggest time unit possible (e.g. 10 days instead of 9 days 13 hours)

# %TRACK_NAMESPACE% - the namespace of a track can be used by other plugins to implement their own layouts
